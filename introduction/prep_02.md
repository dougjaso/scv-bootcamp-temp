# Enable Omni-Channel

Before you can turn on Voice, enable Omni-Channel so your agents can make and receive calls. Service Cloud Voice agents use the Omni-Channel widget to handle all contact types, including voice. There is no additional soft phone required, and agents do not use the standard Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP). 

>**_IMPORTANT:_** Salesforce uses your My Domain subdomain name to configure single sign-on for Service Cloud Voice. Donâ€™t change the My Domain name after you turn on Voice. Otherwise, you have to restart your Voice implementation.

1.  Login to Salesforce as an administrator
1.  From Setup, enter `Omni-Channel Settings` in the Quick Find box, then select **Omni-Channel Settings**.
1.  Select **Enable Omni-Channel**.
1.  Select **Omni-Channel settings** to enable features.

Once you have enabled Omni-Channel, you need to enable Salesforce as an identity provider.
