# New to Salesforce?
[![Salesforce Setup](/static/01/salesforce_setup.png)](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/starting_force_com)
All Salesforce configuration tasks will be done in the Salesforce platform. This is where you will enable voice, create your contact center, manage your users, and handle contacts. If you have limited experience with Salesforce, you can complete the [Salesforce Platform Basics module](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/starting_force_com) on Trailhead to get more accquainted with it. This training module is free, but does require you to sign up for a [Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/) account. If you're already comfortable with Salesforce, feel free to skip this step.
