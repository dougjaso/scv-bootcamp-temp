In order to successfully complete this workshop, attendees must have access to the following resources:

### All session types
*  A laptop, PC or Mac, with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox installed and configured
*  A stable network connection with access to the public internet
*  Preferred: Two monitors or a sizeable enough monitor to comfortable fit two windows. For in-person courses, a tablet that can be used as an external monitor will work fine.
*  An email address, such as Gmail, that can be used specifically for routing emails with Salesforce. Ideally, this should be a new emaill address that you create just for this course.
*  A prepared Salesforce Developer environment with Service Cloud Voice enabled. The next section, **Preparing a workshop environment** will guide you through that process.

### Remote sessions
*  [Amazon Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/download/) installed and configured.
*  A comfortable, private work location as this is a three day, hands on course with long stretches of instruction

Additionally, attendees should have some idea as to what Service Cloud Voice and Amazon Connect are. For those with limited exposure, here are two short videos (right/control click and open in a new tab/window):
